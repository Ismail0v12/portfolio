Hi there! Ever since I was young, designing and creating has always been my thing. One day, I stumbled upon a website, not just any website, but a beautifully crafted and interactive one. That’s when my passion for web development was ignited. It was like magic how the color combinations, animations, and functionalities made a website come alive.

With a computer science degree from NammQI under my belt, I landed my first job at DataSite technology where I had the privilege of working with a skilled and innovative team. Here, we developed interactive websites for high-profile clients, enhancing their online presence and customer engagement. I invested 3 glorious years here, leading projects, managing a team, and even coding an entire eCommerce platform from scratch.

Post that, I joined Websailors.pro as their Front End Developer. This was a challenging role, but one that I absolutely loved. Here, I got the opportunity to build and scale up the front-end of ten unique web applications using Nextjs and ReactJS. I also designed a user-friendly interface that increased customer retention by 35%.

When not at work, you’ll find me swimming because like any another person I take care of my health, specially last 2 years.

I am always open to discussing anything related to tech, web development. Please feel free to shoot me an email at orifismailov08@gmail.com if you want to talk about any of these or collaborate on a project.

Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Next js, Bootstrap, Typescript, UX/UI design, Cross-browser compatibility, cross-mobile development, unit testing
